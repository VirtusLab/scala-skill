# Resource Management

## Dependencies

- `"com.softwaremill.ox" %% "core"` — `useInScope`, `useCloseableInScope`

---

## Resources tied to scope lifecycle

In a direct-style application, resources (database connections, HTTP clients,
SDK instances) need to be released when the application shuts down. Ox ties
resource lifecycle to concurrency scopes: resources are acquired when the scope
starts and released — in reverse order — when the scope ends.

## useInScope and useCloseableInScope

`useInScope` acquires a resource and registers a custom release function:

```scala
supervised {
  val resource = useInScope(acquire())(release)
  // use resource
}
// release is called automatically
```

`useCloseableInScope` is a shorthand for resources that implement
`AutoCloseable`:

```scala
supervised {
  val db = useCloseableInScope(DB.createTestMigrate(config.db))
  // use db
}
// db.close() is called automatically
```

## Application resource setup

The `Dependencies.create` method acquires all resources within the application's
root scope:

```scala
def create(using Ox): Dependencies =
  val config = Config.read.tap(Config.log)
  val otel = initializeOtel()
  val sttpBackend = useInScope(
    Slf4jLoggingBackend(
      OpenTelemetryMetricsBackend(
        OpenTelemetryTracingBackend(HttpClientSyncBackend(), otel),
        otel
      )
    )
  )(_.close())
  val db: DB = useCloseableInScope(DB.createTestMigrate(config.db))

  create(config, otel, sttpBackend, db, DefaultClock)
```

When the application receives SIGTERM:
1. The root scope is interrupted
2. All forks (HTTP server, background processes) are interrupted and awaited
3. Resources are released in reverse order: first the database pool, then the
   sttp backend

Resources are released in reverse acquisition order — later resources may depend
on earlier ones. For example, the HTTP server (which uses the database) is
stopped before the database connection pool is closed.

## OxApp ensures cleanup

`OxApp` is the entry point that makes this work. It installs signal handlers for
SIGINT/SIGTERM and initiates orderly scope termination:

```scala
object Main extends OxApp.Simple:
  override def run(using Ox): Unit =
    val deps = Dependencies.create  // acquires resources via useInScope
    deps.emailService.startProcesses()
    deps.httpApi.start().discard
    never  // blocks until interrupted
```

`OxApp` converts signals and `sys.exit()` into scope interruptions, ensuring
resources are released.
