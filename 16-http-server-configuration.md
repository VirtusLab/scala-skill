# HTTP Server Configuration

## Dependencies

- `"com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir" %% "tapir-netty-server-sync"` — HTTP server
  with synchronous backend
- `"com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir" %% "tapir-files"` — serving static files

---

## Security headers

HTTP responses should include headers that prevent common attacks. These are
added to `baseEndpoint`, so every endpoint in the application inherits them:

```scala
val baseEndpoint: PublicEndpoint[Unit, Fail, Unit, Any] =
  endpoint
    .errorOut(failOutput)
    .out(header("X-Frame-Options", "DENY"))
    .out(header("Content-Security-Policy", "frame-ancestors 'none'"))
```

- **`X-Frame-Options: DENY`** — prevents the page from being embedded in an
  `<iframe>`, blocking clickjacking attacks.
- **`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`** — the CSP equivalent,
  supported by modern browsers that ignore `X-Frame-Options` in favour of CSP.

Both headers are set because older browsers may only support one or the other.
Since these are Tapir output headers, they're included in every successful
response. Error responses (decode failures, 404s) are handled separately by the
server options — see [Error Output Customisation](05-error-output-customisation.md).

## CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing headers are needed when the frontend is served
from a different origin than the API (e.g., during development with a local dev
server). Tapir provides a built-in CORS interceptor:

```scala
val serverOptions: NettySyncServerOptions = NettySyncServerOptions.customiseInterceptors
  .corsInterceptor(CORSInterceptor.default[Identity])
  // ... other interceptors
  .options
```

`CORSInterceptor.default[Identity]` allows all origins, methods, and headers.
For production, restrict the allowed origins:

```scala
import sttp.tapir.server.interceptor.cors.{CORSConfig, CORSInterceptor}

val corsInterceptor = CORSInterceptor.customOrThrow[Identity](
  CORSConfig.default.allowOrigin("https://example.com")
)
```

The CORS interceptor is part of the server options interceptor chain (see
[OpenTelemetry Observability](03-opentelemetry-observability.md) for the full
chain ordering). It handles preflight `OPTIONS` requests automatically.

## Serving static files

For single-page applications, the backend serves the frontend's static assets
(HTML, JS, CSS) and falls back to `index.html` for client-side routes:

```scala
import sttp.tapir.files.{FilesOptions, staticResourcesGetServerEndpoint}

val webappEndpoints = List(
  staticResourcesGetServerEndpoint[Identity](emptyInput: EndpointInput[Unit])(
    classOf[HttpApi].getClassLoader,
    "webapp",
    FilesOptions.default[Identity].defaultFile(List("index.html"))
  )
)
```

`staticResourcesGetServerEndpoint` serves files from the `webapp` directory on
the classpath. The `emptyInput` means it matches any path not already handled by
API endpoints.

`defaultFile(List("index.html"))` is the key for SPA support: when a request
doesn't match any static file (e.g., `/login`, `/settings`), the server returns
`index.html` instead of 404. The frontend's router then handles the path
client-side.

These endpoints are added after the API endpoints:

```scala
val allEndpoints = apiEndpoints ++ webappEndpoints
```

Order matters — API endpoints are matched first. Only unmatched requests fall
through to static file serving.

## Request cancellation

When a client disconnects mid-request (e.g., a user navigates away), the server
can either interrupt the in-progress handler or let it finish. By default, Tapir
interrupts the handler. For applications using database connections, this can
cause problems:

```scala
val serverOptions: NettySyncServerOptions = NettySyncServerOptions.customiseInterceptors
  // ... interceptors
  .options
  .copy(interruptServerLogicWhenRequestCancelled = false)
```

Setting `interruptServerLogicWhenRequestCancelled = false` lets cancelled
requests run to completion. This avoids a specific issue with connection pools:
when a JDBC call is interrupted mid-execution, the connection pool (e.g.,
HikariCP) may mark that connection as broken. Re-establishing connections is
more expensive than finishing the already-running request.

This is a direct-style concern — with virtual threads, each request handler runs
on its own thread, and interrupting it means interrupting the virtual thread
while it may be mid-transaction.
